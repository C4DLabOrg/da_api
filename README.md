### Dependancies

Digital Attendance uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [DjangoREST Framework](https://django-rest-framework.org) - Development of the API
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python Framework
* [Ionic 2](https://ionicframework.com) - Development of the mobile Application

And of course Digital Attendance itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/C4DLabOrg/da_api) on GitHub.


### Installation

Digital Attendance requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

Clone the [public repo](https://github.com/C4DLabOrg/da_api.git) and create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
